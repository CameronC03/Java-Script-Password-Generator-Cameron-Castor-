I made this website from html starter code and little bit of java and tried to make it look like the mock up as good as I could. I faced a lot of challenges making it because it was the first site i have used java in a project outside of class on my own. What motivated me to do the project was it was the first site using java that i have done. I learned java can be tricky and time consuming. I also leanred to have distinct names on stuff or it will confuse you.
